    <p class="vibin"> This playlist is where I keep the few songs that I am currently listening to the most, it changes very often and could be gone in a month </p>
    <p class="jam-mix"> This is my main playlist where I put music (usually in English) that I can jam out too. Hence the name </p>
    <p class="goodies"> This is my playlist for music that isn't currently or recently popular (also mostly in English). The oldies but goodies contains really old music but also some 2000s jams </p>
